# image_to_ascii_converter
Image-to-ASCII app using micro service architecture.

This project was done for my CS 361 class.  The goal of the class was to make an app 
comprised of RESTful microservices that could be used by others in our group.  This app is comprised of 
four separate py files that run by themselves and check, change, and react to changes made to specific 
txt files.
